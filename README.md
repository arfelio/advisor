You are in the 2000 year. The Internet is very poor developed. There are no booking and social

services. And you have a great idea... You should develop a prototype of the application, where

users can add a hotels which they have visited and put а rating for them.

Lets start with this simple workflow

1. As a user I can register. As a user I can sign in.

2. As a user I can see a list of hotels.

3. As a user I can add a hotel. Hotel has next attributes:

a. title(required)

b. star rating(required)

c. breakfast included?

d. room description

e. photo

f. price for room

g. address(different object) ­ country, state, city, street

4. As a user on hotel details page I can rate a hotel from 1 to 5 with comment.

5. On the landing page display top 5 hotels with the best rating.
